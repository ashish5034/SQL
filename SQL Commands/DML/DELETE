DELETE

Delete command will remove the data from a table. If you want to delete all records from table then mention the delete statement without the WHERE condition. Else mention WHERE condition to specify the exact records to be deleted.

The syntax is:

DELETE FROM STUDENTS WHERE ID = 'STD10251'; -- Removes only one record.

DELETE FROM STUDENTS; -- Removes all data from table.
